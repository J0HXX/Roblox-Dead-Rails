3. Load the script from the extracted files.
4. Execute the script while in the game.

For detailed guidance, refer to the **Usage** section below.

## Usage

After successfully installing the script, you can use the aimbot in-game. Hereâ€™s how to get started:

1. Ensure that your script executor is running.
2. Load the aimbot script.
3. You should see a user interface with various settings.
4. Adjust the settings to your liking.
5. Start playing the game, and the aimbot will automatically assist you in aiming and shooting.

Make sure to test different configurations to find what works best for you.

## How It Works

The aimbot utilizes a script that tracks enemy positions in real-time. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the process:

1. **Target Tracking**: The script scans the game environment for enemy players. It identifies their locations and movements.
2. **Aiming Logic**: Once a target is detected, the aimbot calculates the optimal angle to aim at the enemy.
3. **Shooting Mechanism**: The script triggers the shooting action as soon as the aim is locked, ensuring that you hit your target instantly.

This combination of tracking and shooting makes combat in Dead Rails much easier, allowing you to focus on strategy rather than aiming.
